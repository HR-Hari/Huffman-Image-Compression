# Huffman Image Compression

This repository provides **lossless Huffman image compression** implemented in both **Python** and **MATLAB/Octave**. It demonstrates image compression, reconstruction, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- Huffman coding for image compression  
- Python GUI version for interactive compression/decompression  
- MATLAB/Octave version for manual pipeline, entropy analysis, PSNR calculation  
- Comparison with inbuilt Huffman functions
